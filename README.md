# The R.P.S.L.S Game!

### Purpose and Target Audience.

The R.P.S.L.S Game is a simple game based of the Big Bang Theory version of a Rock Paper Scissors game by introducing the extra values Lizard and Spock. The game is completely based around luck and no skill is needed to play, this is because the computer is completely randomized and cannot be predicted. The target user for this project is someone that just wants to play a very simple game to take a break.
